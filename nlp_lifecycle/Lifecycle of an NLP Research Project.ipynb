We can count the number of each type of label, or view the labels as a histogram. If the dataset is unbalanced, then remedial measures can be utilized to balance the classes out. Alternatively, many algorithms (including PyTorch) let you give weights to the classes in order to help the algorithm be less biased.\n",

For instance, if the space articles were only collected on conversations surrounding studying star formation, the classifier would likely not be able to as accuratly classify articles on Martian exploration. It is very important to make sure that your use case matches the intended/expected use of the dataset."

We are going to start with a very simple model as the later lessons will go into more of the deep learning techniques. So the very first model we will try is a bag of words model (BOW) with Term Frequency, Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) into a logistic regression. \n",

    "Basically, BOW will count the number of each words occurance. TF-IDF will then weight the words that occur less frequenty in the overal corpus (aka all of our documents) so that the more infrequent words have a higher count. SKlearn has a built in function TfidfVectorizer() that we will use. One aspect to not here is that TfidfVectorizer() can remove stop words at this stage as well, but we already took care of that step in cleaning. As a side note, it definitely is not as important to remove stop words when using TF-IDF as the most frequent words are discounted naturally due to the number of times they appear in the corpus."

    "# Data Science Ethics Checklist\n",
    "\n",
    "## A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [ ] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have those subjects have given informed consent, where users clearly understand what they are consenting to and there was a mechanism in place for gathering consent?\n",
    " - [ ] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    " - [ ] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "## B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [ ] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "## C. Analysis\n",
    " - [ ] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "## D. Modeling\n",
    " - [ ] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.5 Communicate bias**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "## E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Concept drift**: Do we test and monitor for concept drift to ensure the model remains fair over time?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
